# Welcome to My SQL Portfolio!  

This repository showcases my SQL work, including data queries, analysis, and problem-solving techniques. I use SQL to extract insights, manipulate datasets, and optimize data retrieval.  

### What's Inside:
- **SQL Queries** – Well-structured queries for data exploration and analysis  
- **Data Insights** – Aggregations, joins, and filtering techniques to uncover trends  
- **Projects** – Practical SQL applications for real-world scenarios  

I'm continuously refining my skills and expanding my portfolio. Feel free to explore, and reach out if you'd like to connect!
